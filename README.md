# FESSolarCalculator

Calculate sunrise, sunset, and twilight times for a given location.

## Goals

1. Given a location and a date provide:
    * Sunrise date and time for that location
        * may not be on that day
    * Sunset date and time for that location
        * may not be on that day
    * Twilight times for that location:
        * Official
        * Civil
        * Nautical
        * Astronomical
2. Allow the user to disable some calculations (e.g., only calculate Official Twilight) when run.
3. Provide an easy way to get the information out.
